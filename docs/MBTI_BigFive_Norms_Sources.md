## Notes

- The values provided are approximate averages synthesized from multiple sources and should be updated as new research emerges.  
- Individual variation within types is substantial; these averages serve as general guides rather than strict norms.  
- The Big Five traits are continuous dimensions; MBTI types provide a typological lens that correlates but does not perfectly predict Big Five scores.

These normative values are intended to enhance introspective feedback within the Eidon system and do not serve as diagnostic or clinical thresholds.
