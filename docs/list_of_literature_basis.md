### Notes:

- The MBTI is grounded in Jungian psychological type theory, operationalized by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs.
- Socionics, while related, is a distinct typology system that shares Jungian roots and MBTI-type mappings; its intertype relations are mathematically derived from altered MBTI variables and P/J dichotomy.
- Jung’s original concepts of psychological types, archetypes, and the collective unconscious provide the theoretical foundation for both MBTI and Socionics.
- The MBTI’s psychometric validity and practical applications are well documented but also critically examined in peer-reviewed literature.
- The above sources include peer-reviewed articles, authoritative book chapters, and comprehensive reviews supporting the theoretical and empirical basis of the implemented system.
